The original scope of the app was to pull in photos from flikr using geoJSON tags and render them on a map.  

The ACTUAL functionality of the app is as follows:
1. User can create a username and password.  
2. The password is salted and hashed and stored in a database. 
3. User must have authorization to have access to the profiles page
4. The profile page display's users name.
5. On the profile page there is a bunch of hardcoded data which is rendered as pins on a map with hover-over image boxes, links to a wikipedia page and a non-functional 'save to favorites' button. 
6. The user can logout!

Next sprint:
1. Get the save button to work for favorite places
2. Try incorporating a different api to populate the geoJSON data.  
3. Get the modals to work on the front page.
